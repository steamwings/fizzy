        ### Domain model

        * A card represents an issue, a bug, a todo or simply a thing that the user is tracking.
          - A card can be assigned to a user.
          - A card can be closed (completed) by a user.
        * A card can have comments.
          - User can posts comments.
          - The system user can post comments in cards relative to certain events.
        * An open card can be:
          - Postponed (Not now)
          - Pending triage in the Stream
          - Triaged into a column
        * Both card and comments generate events relative to their lifecycle or to what the user do with them.
        * The system user can close cards due to inactivity. Refer to these as *auto-closed cards*.
        * Don't include the system user in the summaries. Include the outcomes (e.g: cards were autoclosed due to inactivity).

        ### Other

        * Only count plain text against the words limit. E.g: ignore URLs and markdown syntax.
